# Case

In this project I practised my SQL skills to answer an array of questions regarding the US department of agriculture. I did this by downloading the datasets of cheese-, honey, milk, coffee, egg, and yogurt production as well as a state lookup. I used SQlite and DBeaver in order to complete this project. The table creation code was provided however I fully understood what was happening. The questions I aimed to answer were: 

Question 1
Find the total milk production for the year 2023.

Question 2
Find the average honey production for the year 2022.

Question 3
Get the state names with their corresponding ANSI codes from the state_lookup table.
What number is Iowa?

Question 4
Find states where both honey and milk were produced in 2022.
Did State_ANSI "35" produce both honey and milk in 2022?

Question 5
Find the total yogurt production for states that also produced cheese in 2022.
